Traceur
=======
Traceur enables easier debugging of RxJava2 exceptions, by appending the source of any asynchronous calls to the
original exception.

An example RxJava exception:
![](assets/stacktrace-without-traceur.png)

The same exception with Traceur enabled:
![](assets/stacktrace-with-traceur.png)

Notice that the call site of the asynchronous call is linked in the stack trace (`SplashPresenter`).

RxJava1 had a similar feature included by default, `RxJavaHooks.enableAssemblyTracking()`, but RxJava2 has
no such feature unfortunately.


Usage
-----
Enable logging:
```
Traceur.enableLogging();
```

Disable logging:
```
Traceur.disableLogging();
```

Download
--------
```
compile 'com.tspoon.traceur:traceur:1.0.1'
```


Thanks
------
Thanks to [David Karnok](https://github.com/akarnokd) - this project is largely just an enhancement of his
[RxJava2Extensions](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions) project, making it slightly easier to consume as a
developer
