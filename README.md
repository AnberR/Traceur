Traceur
=======
Traceur enables easier debugging of RxJava2 exceptions, by appending
the source of any asynchronous calls to the original exception.

An example RxJava exception:
![](assets/stacktrace-without-traceur.png)



The same exception with Traceur enabled:
![](assets/stacktrace-with-traceur.png)

Notice that the source of the asynchronous call is linked in the stack
trace.

Usage
-----
Enable logging:
```
Traceur.enableLogging();
```

Disable logging:
```
Traceur.disableLogging();
```

Download
--------
```
compile 'com.tspoon.traceur:traceur:1.0.0'
```
